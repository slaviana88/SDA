# A Dictionary, using a Trie

This project is implemented a dictionary that contains words and their full exmplanation.

Here are the details about that project:

* **To implement the dictionary, using a Trie data structure**. [You can read more about Trie here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie)
* Java Swing Application ([You can use windowbuilder for help](https://eclipse.org/windowbuilder/)) that gives the ability to perform **CRUD** operations on the words and the meanings.
* Saving data to a file. Build the trie every time when starting the application.

**CRUD** means create, read, update, delete.

There should be options to:

* Add new word with meaning to it.
* Update an existing word of meaning.
* Remove a word with its meaning.
* Show all words and all meanings.
